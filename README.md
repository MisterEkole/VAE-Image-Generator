# VAE-Image-Generator

Variational autoencoders, simultaneously discovered by Kingma and Welling in
December 2013 and Rezende, Mohamed, and Wierstra in January 2014 are a kind
of generative model thatâ€™s especially appropriate for the task of image editing via concept
vectors.

This repository presents an implementation of  generative deep learning model(Variational Autoencoders) trained on MNIST dataset.
